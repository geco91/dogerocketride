# dogerocketride

Simple app for the emf2016 badge TILDA MK3 ... feel free to improve it :)

Manual Install on the badge

Download the ZIP file: https://github.com/geco91/dogerocketride/archive/master.zip

Connect your TILDA badge thru USB cable (it mounts like an USB stick). Within the "apps" directory create a directory called "rootzoll~dogerocketride" and unpack the files from the ZIP file into it (just plain all the files - no further directories).

Now remove the the TILDA from your computer (eject USB device). Press the "menu" button. Navigate to "View All" ... there in the list you should now see "dogerocketride". Navigate to it and press button A to start.

Now your doge is spinning :)
